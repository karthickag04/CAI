Capture Front-ends Linked to Backend
Systems and Web Applications

Exisiting applications can be improved or
extended using OCR for easy capture of input
of data to a networked backend system or
Web applicaition. For example:

Mobile capture for CRM - take a picture of
a business card for input into a CRM
system or sales lead database

Mobile capture for Workflow - take a
picture of a document for fast input into a
workflow application

Client/server text conversion and
processing - collecting pieces of texts and
other data via mobile phone camera and
sending to a Web or other server for
processing. Mobile OCR can be used for
pre-recognition and to check image
quality, before sending to a server for
processing.
